I am a <b>MEng Chemical Engineering Graduate </b> from The University of Manchester.
<p>My Masters Dissetation focused on the creation of classification models to identify cocoa powder from its carob powder adulterants for pharmaceutcal use.</p>
  <p>&#128963; Involved the preparation of data, exploratory analysis and the use of three machine learning models</p>
    <p>&#129026; Random Forest model
    <p>&#129026; Logistic Regression model
    <p>&#129026; Partial-Least-Squares Regression Model
  <p>&#128963; The aim was to create a rapid testing method to authenticate cocoa powder that could be used on industrial sites by common employees.
